This project is inspired by scrimba tutorial.
Its my first project i am coding from start after seeing the design in their tutorial.
So provided design is almost theirs also. I changed small things here and there. Like I added a footer with social icons and a credit section.
Now you may ask why i am uploading it if it's already on github? Because i want to keep the changes i made as it is and also i am lazy so i can copy the whole thing if wanted to make a birthday card for someone else.
All files included in this project are files i found online so i don't hold copyright of any of them.
If you are wondering from where i downloaded the icons, i downloaded them from icon8.com.They have great icons collection you can download for free and they are free to use(copyright free).
